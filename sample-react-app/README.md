## Adding Your Own Code

After cloning the repository, you can start adding your own code. Here are some tips on where to add your code:

- **Components**: If you're creating new React components, navigate to the `src/components` directory and create a new folder for your component.
- **Styles**: For any CSS styles, you can add them in the `src/App.css` file or create a new CSS file in the corresponding component's folder.
- **API Integration**: If you need to integrate with APIs, you can modify the existing files in the `src/components/NoSqlenddata` or `src/components/Sqlenddata.js` directories.

Make sure to follow the existing code structure and conventions for consistency.
